# minishell
ðŸ’»ðŸ”›ðŸ™‡ A project that aims to create its own terminal.

#### Objective of program:
Our program is a command-shell. It has several [builtins functions](#builtins-functions), and it's also able to run any other binary program files that are located on paths from PATH. Our **minishell** is able to handle [redirects](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Redirections.html) and [pipelines](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Pipelines.html) similar to bash.

#### Builtins functions:
* `echo` with option â€™-nâ€™
* `cd` with only a relative or absolute path
* `pwd` without any options
* `export` without any options
* `unset` without any options
* `env` without any options and any arguments
* `exit` without any options
